        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>These crispy oven-baked kale chips are a great homemade snack.</p>
        <p>You cannot stop at just eating one, just like potato chips. Great for parties, too.</p>
        
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
       
            <p>1 bunch kale</p>
            <p>1 tablespoon olive oil</p>
            <p>1 teaspoon flaked sea salt</p>
        

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        
            <p>Preheat an oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper.</p>
            <p>With a knife or kitchen shears carefully remove kale leaves from the thick stems and tear into bite size pieces. Wash and thoroughly dry kale with a salad spinner. Drizzle kale leaves with olive oil and toss to combine. Spread out in an even layer on the baking sheet without overlapping and sprinkle with salt.</p>
            <p>Bake until the edges start to brown but are not burnt, 20 to 30 minutes.</p>
