        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>The perfect hard-boiled egg is not boiled at all but rather steamed!</p>
        <p>This secret was leaked by a chef, and it is the best way I've found for easy peeling and no green yolks.</p>
        
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        
        <p>12 large eggs</p>
        

        <h2>Steps</h2>
       
            <p>Fill a stainless steel steamer pot with about 1 inch water and bring to a boil.</p>
            <p>Add eggs to the steamer tray, carefully lower into the pot, cover, and reduce heat. Cook for 10 minutes for medium yolks or 15 minutes for fully-cooked yolks.</p>

            <p>Gently crack each egg, roll on a cutting board, then peel the shell off from the fat end towards the point.</p>
