        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>the perfect hard-boiled egg is not boiled at all but rather steamed!</p>
        <p>This secret was leaked by a chef, and it is the best way I've found for easy peeling and no green yolks.</p>
        
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>12 large eggs</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Fill a stainless steel steamer pot with about 1 inch water and bring to a boil.</li>
            <li>Add eggs to the steamer tray, carefully lower into the pot, cover, and reduce heat. Cook for 10 minutes for medium yolks or 15 minutes for fully-cooked yolks.</li>
